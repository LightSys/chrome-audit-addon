## About `popup.html`

The `popup.html` file controls what is displayed when the icon is clicked. It is a simple html file with some css imported from the `css/popup.css` file. 


```html
    <script src="libraries/jquery-3.2.0.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="popup.js"></script>
```

These lines cause the `libraries/jquery-3.2.0.min.js` and `popup.js` scripts to be run when the html is displayed.
