## About `testconfig.json`

This is a test configuration file. The URL to it is hardcoded as a default configuration, but it is strongly recommended that an administrator [create their own](../writing_config.md). It contains a whitelist of acceptable extensions and their ID's, and a list of URL's to which the X-Audit header is sent. This file is in a simple JSON format.
