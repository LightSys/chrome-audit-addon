## About `options.html`

This creates the options page that can be accessed from both the chrome://extensions page and the context click menu from the icon. On the page, is an input box with the current URL for the configuration file, which can be modified to a new URL. There is also a save button, which stores the current URL from the input box to the extensions's storage.
